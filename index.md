<h3>Intro</h3>
Hello, I am Angel. First year college student at United Tribes Technical College, majoring in Information Technology. I graduated HS back in 2017 so I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to be in college for and it's exactly this! I plan to take this field of study all the way. Coding is what I will do for the rest of my life (once I figure it out.) So I am very grateful to have gotten this oppurtunity to be part of this internship. I think this will be a very fun experience and I am looking forward to it. 
<h3>Bio</h3>
I am enrolled in the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. I have three kids, ages are four, two, and one month! I do a lot of working out, specifically boxing. I was the 178 lbs female elite Golden Glove champion in 2021. Currently working towards a 2023 championship as well. I love to listen to punk music, sing, play video games, cook, all while maintaining and satisfying two toddlers and an infant, I also love being a mom.
